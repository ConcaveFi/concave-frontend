# ðŸ¥„ Concave Frontend

This is the worlds best kept secret frontend monorepo

## Resources

Reading the following tools docs will help you navigate and develop in this repo

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features)
- [wagmi](https://wagmi-xyz.vercel.app/)
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

## Turbo Monorepo

We have two main workspaces: `apps` and `libs`

### apps

- `cave`: main concave app, bond, swap etc
- `marketplace`: NFT Marketplace app

bootstraping a new concave app? put it in `/apps`

### libs

- `@concave/ui`: has all chakra-ui components + more, you should add shared more abstracted components here, let use case specifics for each app components folder
- `@concave/icon`: has all chakra-ui icons + more

create more shared libs as you feel necessary in `/libs`
