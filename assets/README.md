# Concave Assets

This folder should be used to store shared assets, like font's that are defined on `@concave/ui` but must be served by `cave`.

symlinks are behave weirldly on windows, and vercel builds, so everything moved inside `cave` app public folder until someone figure out how to config it properly.
